# cnpj/cpf/uuid generator cli

## Installation

```elixir
mix escript.install github george124816/generator
```

## Usage
```elixir
generator cnpj
generator uuid
generator cpf
```

After you install the escript, make sure you add the directory where Elixir keeps escripts to your $PATH. If you installed Elixir with asdf, you'll need to run `asdf reshim elixir` once the escript is built.
